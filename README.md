## üìÇ Group Information
- **Group Number:** 13
- **Group Name:** Bays

## üìù Project Title
**Tabmark**

## üìñ Project Description
Tabmark organizes and saves the tabs of the user's choice. The user can get back on track of their project with ease. The website also reminds of the upcoming deadlines, preventing procrastination. Further, the secondary feature is an AI-driven schedule that first gives a user a survey, to detail the current commitments of a person, e.g. courses, other work priorities as well as fitness goals, encompassing a productive life roadmap.

## Features
1. Save an entire window (all the tabs) as like a saved folder of some kind whenever you're doing a project.  This helps you continue where you left off much more easily
2. Remind you of Deadlines, which is split into 4 categories (placeholder name and time):
    a) Not Urgent (>1 month away)
    b) Close (2-4 weeks away)
    c) Up coming (1-2 week away)
    d) URGENT!! (1 week away)
3. If something is in URGENT!!, the website will always have it pop up to constantly remind you
4. Has a in-depth survey that asks a person their priorities for the coming semester (chosen block of months) including courses, work as well as fitness goals. It will then also ask how much importance they give to each responsibility, taking that into consideration and crafting a well-balanced schedule.
5. Also tracks important dates i.e midterms, projects, exams, highlighting them and using AI-driven features to modify schedule for week(s) before important dates.

## Sub-features
- Subtasks: Assignment can be broken down into subtasks e.g. 'Research', 'First Code Draft, 'Debugging' etc etc and certain tabs from the whole window can be assigned to these subtasks.
- Calendar: Sync up with calendar apps, using calendar APIs, allows emails, etc to be sent, to be notified once assignements reach the 'Up Coming' tag

__**Goal:**__ Help the user organize projects on a web browsers more conveniently, and prevent procrastination. The website will have constant reminders of deadline's when user is logged in. It will also create a tailored schedule that entails a responsible, productive balance of coursework, fitness goals, etc.
